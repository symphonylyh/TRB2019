Installation
###########################################################################
This code is tested with MATLAB 2009b on Linux x86_64
While the majority of our code is in matlab, this package contain codes
that need to be compiled natively.
If you find it not working, please go to the authors' page to find one that
works for your platform.

1. Meanshift code:
http://coewww.rutgers.edu/riul/research/code/EDISON/index.html
2. Tom Briggs's mex wrapper for svm light:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mex-svm/
3. A toolbox that includes graphcuts solving by Mark Schmidt and Kevin Murphy
http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/UGM.html

Included ones are compiled and tested using Matlab Version 7.9.0.529 (R2009b)

Usage
###########################################################################
See deshadow_driver.m for a demo of detection and removal

Note: You may need to deal with gamma correction.
For most digital cameras, gamma correction is done automatically.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction

We prefer that the image are captured in raw format and linearly transformed
from raw format.
If this is not done, please set 'opt.linearize' to 1 in the code, which
converts sRGB images to linear intensity.
