Problematic: e.g., 60-2
1. Due to the adaptive thresholding, some dark area will be missed. Switch to binary thresholding can fix case by case. In illiSeg.m, ~imbinarize(dist, 0.25) typically 0.25, 0.3, 0.32. Or, change the adaptthresh parameter - sensitivity.

2. Due to the power on the blue cloth, some of them will be recognized as rock. In illiSeg.m, first erode and then dilate can get rid of the small objects. Use larger erode-dilate radius.
% Morphological operations on binary mask
bw = imerode(bw, strel('disk', 6 * sigma)); % imdilate's correspondence
bw = imdilate(bw, strel('disk', 6 * sigma)); % obtain a closed boundary
bw = imfill(bw, 4, 'holes'); % fill holes inside a connected region, 8-connected is more strict and fill fewer holes
%bw = imerode(bw, strel('disk', 2 * sigma)); % imdilate's correspondence
bw = imopen(bw, strel('disk', 2 * sigma)); % open: open holes (or remove objects), erode + dilate
bw = bwareaopen(bw, ceil(h/50) * ceil(w/50), 4); % remove small object
bw = imclearborder(bw, 8); % clear meaningless regions that are connected to image border
